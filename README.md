# Company XYZ's Data Across the Country

This project was undertaken to understand how customers respond to the product of company XYZ and help the company boost and concentrate production through the thorough business and analytical insights that were discovered.

# Project Steps

Step 1 - Loading the Dataset
I imported the company's dataset and combined them for easy analysis.

Step 2 - Data Exploration
I explored the datasets using some pandas fuctions to get concentrated insights.

Step 3 - Dealing with DateTime Features
I discovered that the date sequence could be a probloem in analyzing data from the dataset. So I converted the date DataType to DateTime so as extract feautures from Date and Time columns for easy analysis.

Step 4 - Unique Values in Columns
I checked for unique values like: list of unavailbale names, available names, total number of cutomers etc...

Step 5 - Aggregration with GroupBy
I singled out the City column to help me get relevant insight from the data e.g the gross income of each state.

Step 6 - Data Visualization
Here you would understand the entire process graphically.
Questions like: Who uses this product more? At what rate is this product used? etc can be easily interpreted here.This would help convince the Board of Directors in either maintaining, scraping or promoting a particular product based on raw facts!

# Standout Section
I found the maximum value per unit price.

I visualized the relationship between Product line and Quantity using Gender as hue.

I visualized the relationship between Product line and Unit Price using Gender as hue.

I visualized the Product Line histplot using Payment as hue.

I visualized the Product Line histplot using Branch as hue.

# Insights

I discovered the dataset was well placed together without any omissions but I had to convert the Date and Time datatypes for easy analysis.
I discovered the rate at which consumers buy products and how the entire data columns can be used to help solve so many unanswered questions based on facts!


# Future Work

I would love to include some machine learning algorithm to help make predictive and precriptive analysis on this project based on the decisions made by the company.

# Executive Summary.
